<p style="text-align:center">I am a Diversity Consultant, Project Coordinator, Workshop Instructor and Writer with a passion for Gender Equality. I love learning languages, traveling and animals.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Sophia sakura6.jpg" alt="me" class="u-max-full-width" /></p>

<h5 id="a-passion-for-diversity">A passion for Diversity</h5>
<p>I love taking on new challenges. My passion is to create and coordinate projects that make a real difference in our societies. When I’m able to help and empower people, I am thriving the most. I hope that my work will always be able to promote fact-driven critical thinking.</p>

<p>My goal is to bring diverse, inclusive and respectful thinking into our workplaces and everyday lives.</p>

<p>I’m interested in the premises of respectful and positive human interactions. I am always looking for new ways to balance out our unconscious biases and create awareness for the struggle of different groups. Explaining and leveling out privileges is one of the most challenging parts of this equation.</p>

<h5 id="culture-is-always-a-matter-of-perspective">Culture is always a matter of perspective</h5>

<p>I have always been eager to understand the effect of culture and language on people’s mindsets and habits. That is probably why I have always been drawn to international environments. Through my work at universities and NGOs as well as through my relocation to different countries, I have strong intercultural competences and sensitivity.</p>

<p>I hold a Master of Arts in Sociology with a focus on Gender Studies and Diversity. I also had the pleasure to study the Master “Gender, Culture and Social Change” in Innsbruck, Austria, during my Erasmus exchange semester.</p>

<p>Having this strong analytical background helps me understand the interplay of social issues. I love breaking down complex phenomena and explain them as simply as possible.</p>

<h5 id="a-versatile-profile">A versatile profile</h5>

<p>I enjoy networking and getting to know new interesting people. Public speaking and giving talks is one of my strengths.</p>

<p>I am very structured and like to take on new challenges &amp; roles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a <strong>Project Coordinator</strong>, I enjoy event planning, time scheduling, team-building, monitoring and press work. Coordinating projects comes easily to me since I am a very structured and detail-orientated person.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a <strong>Workshop Instructor &amp; Teacher</strong>, I love inspiring people and to be involved in every part: from development over planning to implementation. I feel most challenged when I can solve conflicts, engage others and find the right approach to the specific composition of a group.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a <strong>Writer</strong>, I am able to use the full range of creativity. I am comfortable writing academically, journalistically and narratively. Recently, I took on the challenge of Social Media Marketing, where I am able to integrate graphic design into my portfolio.</p>
